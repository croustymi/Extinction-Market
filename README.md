# Extinction-Market
Extinction Market is a Discord.JS Bot

## Important information
This bot using Discord.JS v11.5.1, I don't update this bot to Discord.JS v12, v13 or other Discord.JS Versions.
This work is finished for me and usable, I think the command `market remove` don't work, but I'm not sure.

### Utility of this bot
This bot is developed to check if a weapon why the price who you want to buy is on extinction market.
The API Link is not include in the bot, you need to find it yourself (or ask Pichot, the founder of GLife Community).
This bot was developed for a community, but they don't paid me for this work, so I give the bot on GitHub now.

### How to configure ?
1. Go in `config.json`
2. Create a discord bot on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
3. Add your bot token to `"token": ""`
4. Change the prefix if you want, by default the prefix is `!`
5. Add your server ID in `"serverID": ""`, get it why the Discord Developer Mode
6. Add your admin role ID in `"adminID": ""`, this is the only role how can use the commands
7. Add your channel ID in `"channelID": ""`, all announcements for weapons in displayed in this channel

### Support
Go in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/croustymi/Extinction-Market/issues) and create a new issue.
I don't give any support on this project, it's a shitty project for me, I don't edit it more.
